The number of links that are part of any given node is the same as the number of links that leave any given node. \\

\begin{align*}
    &\sum_{a\in N_f^+(u) \cup A_0}{X_{ak}} - \sum_{a\in N_f^-(u) \cup A_0}{X_{ak}} = 0 & \qquad \forall k \in K, \forall u \in V, \forall f \in F \\
\end{align*}

Every node is served by some flow. \\

\begin{align*}
    &\sum_{k \in K}{Y_{ku}=1} & \qquad \forall u \in V \\
\end{align*}

Make sure that node U is only served by flow K if U is inside flow K. \\

\begin{align*}
   &Y_{ku} = \sum_{a\in N^+(u)}{X_{ak}} & \qquad \forall k \in K, \forall u \in V\\
\end{align*}

Make sure that if a flow is responsible for a router, it gets its items. \\

\begin{align*}
    &C_{kv} - C_{ku} = d_v * Y_{kv} & \qquad \forall (u,v) \in V, \forall k \in K\\
\end{align*}

Make sure that the capacity is respected. \\

\begin{align*}
     &C_{ku} \leq Q & \qquad \forall k \in K, \forall u \in V \\
\end{align*}
