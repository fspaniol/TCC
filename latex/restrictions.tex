Make sure that all nodes are covered. \\

\begin{align*}
        &\sum_{k \in K}{X_{ak}=1} & \forall a \in A\\
\end{align*}

Make sure that a route only covers an arch if the flow with the same index passes by it. \\

\begin{align*}
        &X_{af} = 0 & \forall a \in A - f,  \forall f \in F\\
\end{align*}

Make sure that a group only dispatches if it collects in that arch. \\

\begin{align*}
        &X_{ak} \geq Y_{ku} & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

Make sure that if a flow is not collecting a given node, the weight when it arrives there, its 0. \\

\begin{align*}
    &X_{ak} \geq C_{ku} & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

The next two restrictions make sure of the following: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 1 and $C_{kv}$ equals 0, it means that the content was dispatched, therefore $Y_{ku}$ equals 1. \\
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 1 and $C_{kv}$ is more than 0, it means that the content was not dispatched, therefore $Y_{ku}$ equals 0. \\ 
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 0, then $C_{ku}$ has to be 0 and $Y_{ku}$ also has to be 0. \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
        &Y_{ku} - X_{ak} \geq -C_{kv} & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
        &(-Y_{ku} + X_{ak}) * Q \geq C_{kv} & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

The next two restrictions make sure of the following: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 1 and $Y_{ku}$ equals 0, $C_{kv}$ has to be $C_{ku}$ plus 1. \\
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 1 and $Y_{ku}$ equals 1, $C_{kv}$ has to be 0. \\
    \item If $X_{ak}$ equals 0, $C_{kv}$ has to be 0. \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
    &C_{kv} \leq C_{ku} + 1 + (1 - X_{ak}) * Q + Y_{ku} * Q & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
     &C_{kv} \geq C_{ku} + 1 - (1 - X_{ak}) * Q - Y_{ku} * Q & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in A \\
\end{align*}

        
Make sure that if a link that belongs to a node which is last in its flow is collected, dispatch it. \\

\begin{align*}
    &Y_{ku} \geq X_{ak} & \forall k \in K, \forall a = (u,v) \in L \\
\end{align*}
