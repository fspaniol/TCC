\subsection{Constants}
$F$ = Set of flows present in a network. \\
$K$ = Set of solution flows. \\
$A$ = Set of links (or archs) in a given network. \\
$L$ = Set that represents the last links on all flows. \\
$V$ = Sets of routers in a network. \\
$Q$ = Value that defines the max amount any given route can carry.

\subsection{Variables}
$C_{ku}$ =  Array variable that represents the charge of flow k when arriving at node u. \\
$X_{ak}$ =  Binary array variable that controls whether a link a is covered by route k. \\ 
$Y_{ku}$ =  Binary array variable that defines whether route k dispatches on node u. \\
