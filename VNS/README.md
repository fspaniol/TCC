# What to do

The problem we are trying to solve is the In Band Optimization Problem, for that we will use the approach of the Variable Neighborhood search proposed by Pierre Hansen.

## Steps

Local search in non-optimal solution

## Requirements

Effective development
Use data structures to save data
Use 2 different implementations to perform the switches between solutions
Find an optimal meta-heuristic
